# Songsterr to Guitar Pro Downloader 🎸

A simple web app I built to download Guitar Pro files (.gpx, .gp5, .gp, etc) from [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/).

## Current Tech Stack 👨🏻‍💻

- ♻️ [SveleteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) + TypeScript
- 💅🏻 [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) for styling
- 🔥 [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

### NPM packages:

- [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js), for parsing and reading XML/HTML content from the server-side. Basically like JavaScript's built in `DOMParser()`
